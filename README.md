## Problem and Solution
When we give to charities, we rarely have the ability to check how our donations are being used. These can lead to the misuse of funds for vanity projects and predatory pickpocketing by middlemen. Ultimately the individuals who are harmed the most are the beneficiaries who are shortchanged. 

With blockchain technology, we can enable donors to review the track records of charities to build credibility and trust in their donations. Our solution is Solmatch, a donation platform powered by Solana.

SolMatch has three key features: 
<ul>
    <li>Transparent Donations on Chain</li>
    <li>Holding funds in escrow</li>
    <li>Commitment fulfillment to whitelisted suppliers</li>
</ul>

## Process Flow

</p>

1. Charity reaches out to the Team at SolMatch
2. We create a donation contract for the Charity's campaign on Solana and list it on our website
3. Donors can fund the campaign with SOL
4. Once the campaign has been funded, the charity can start executing the commitments that are stipulated in the contract by sending funds to the whitelisted addresses of suppliers
5. Donors can review transactions of the specific charities and the associated campaigns on-chain

## Technical Stack

</p>
<ul>
    <li>The front end of our application was built using Next.js</li>
    <li>Backend infrastructure consists of our interactions on the Solana Blockchain as well as our Firebase Application for linking the campaign IDs to the front end</li>
</ul>
